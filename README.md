Description: 
Image segmentation aims to simplify and/or
change the representation of an image into
something that is more meaningful and easier to
analyze. Existing methods or models is already
excellent on segmenting the images. We would
use two existed models to try image segmentation by ourselves: first K-means model and
second U-net model.
